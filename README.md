## General Information
- Solutions for exercises done in SQL.
- Data was download from csv files to tables for every Path.

## Technologies Used
- PostgreSQL - version 14.3


## Setup
Exercises were split into paths. 
Each one include bellow questions in Ex_List_Path_x and files with SQL statements.

### Path 1 include practises for bellow questions:
1. Select all rows from December 1st, 2000 to December 15th, 2000 (inclusive).
2. Get the average maximum temperature for every year from the year 2000 onward. Order the results by year (ascending).
3. Get the standard deviation of the maximum temperature per year, from 2000 onward. Order by year (ascending).
4. What are the 10 hottest days on record? Take hottest to mean 'highest maximum temperature'.
5. In 2016, what fraction of days did it rain?
6. What is the 75th percentile for the amount of rain that fell on a day where there was some rain in 2016?
7. What is the 75th percentile for the amount of rain that fell on any day in 2016?
8. Get the 10 years with the hottest average maximum temperature in July. Order from hottest to coolest.
9. Get the 10 years with the coldest average minimum temperature in December. Order from coolest to hottest.
10. Repeat the last question 9, but round the temperatures to 3 decimal places.
11. Given the results of the previous queries, would it be fair to use this data to claim that 2015 had the "hottest July on record"? Why or why not?
12. Give the average inches of rain that fell per day for each month, where the average is taken over 2000 - 2010 (inclusive).

### Path 2 include practises for bellow questions:
1. List all the employees in order of descreasing salary.
2. List all the department names, and the number of employees in that department. Order by number of employess in department (greatest to least).
3. List all the employees that don't have a manager.
4. List all employees by name, and the name of their manager. If the employee doesn't have a manager, leave the column as NULL.
5. For each manager, list the number of employees he or she is managing. For these purposes, a manager is anyone who is not managed by someone else, even if that person has no direct reports.
6. Find the two highest paid people per department.

### Path 3 include practises for bellow questions:
1. How many users are there in each house?
2. List all following links that were created before September 1st, 1993.
3. List all rows from the follows table, replacing both user_ids with first name.
4. List all the following links established before September 1st 1993, but this time use the users first names.
5. Give a count of how many people followed each user as of 1999-12-31. Give the result in term of "users full name, number of followers".
6. List the number of users each user follows.
7. List all rows from follows where someone from one house follows someone from a different house.
8. List all unrequited followings (i.e. where A follows B but B does not follow A).
